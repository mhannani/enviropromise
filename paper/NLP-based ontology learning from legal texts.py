NLP-based ontology learning from legal texts. A case study paper



Ontology
--------
Formally-defined vocabulary for a particular domain of interest used to capture
knowledge about that (restricted) domain of interest.
The ontology describes the concepts in the domain and the relationship hold
between those concepts which is necessary for knowledge representation(Field of AI, dedicated
to representing information about the world in form that a computer system use
to solve tasks. From wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning)
and knowledge exchange.

Legal ontology
--------------
        Legal ontology aim to provide a structured representation of legal concepts
    and their interconnections... They are used to model the domain of knowledge
    for which a system is developed and the underlying concepts structure.



Ontology learning
-----------------
        Ontology learning is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies, including
    extracting the corresponding domain's terms and the relationships between the concepts
    that these terms represent from a corpus of natural language text, and encoding them
    with an ontology language for easy retrieval.
